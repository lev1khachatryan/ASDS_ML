    "Random forests is a supervised learning algorithm. It can be used both for classification and regression. It is also the most flexible and easy to use algorithm. A forest is comprised of trees. It is said that the more trees it has, the more robust a forest is. Random forests creates decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests has a variety of applications, such as recommendation engines, image classification and feature selection. It can be used to classify loyal loan applicants, identify fraudulent activity and predict diseases. It lies at the base of the Boruta algorithm, which selects important features in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand the algorithm in layman’s terms. Suppose you want to go on a trip and you would like to travel to a place which you will enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do you do to find a place that you will like? You can search online, read reviews on travel blogs and portals, or you can also ask your friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s suppose you have decided to ask your friends, and talked with them about their past travel experience to various places. You will get some recommendations from every friend. Now you have to make a list of those recommended places. Then, you ask them to vote (or select one best place for the trip) from the list of recommended places you made. The place with the highest number of votes will be your final choice for the trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above decision process, there are two parts. First, asking your friends about their individual travel experience and getting one recommendation out of multiple places they have visited. This part is like using the decision tree algorithm. Here, each friend makes a selection of the places he or she has visited so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part, after collecting all the recommendations, is the voting procedure for selecting the best place in the list of recommendations. This whole process of getting recommendations from friends and voting on them to find the best place is known as the random forests algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It technically is an ensemble method (based on the divide-and-conquer approach) of decision trees generated on a randomly split dataset. This collection of decision tree classifiers is also known as the forest. The individual decision trees are generated using an attribute selection indicator such as information gain, gain ratio, and Gini index for each attribute. Each tree depends on an independent random sample. In a classification problem, each tree votes and the most popular class is chosen as the final result. In the case of regression, the average of all the tree outputs is considered as the final result. It is simpler and more powerful compared to the other non-linear classification algorithms."

    "\n",
    "* Random forests is considered as a highly accurate and robust method because of the number of decision trees participating in the process.\n",

It automatically computes the relevance score of each feature in the training phase. Then it scales the relevance down so that the sum of all scores is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This score will help you choose the most important features and drop the least important ones for model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest uses ***gini importance*** or mean decrease in impurity (***MDI***) to calculate the importance of each feature. Gini importance is also known as the total decrease in node impurity. This is how much the model fit or accuracy decreases when you drop a variable. The larger the decrease, the more significant the variable is. Here, the mean decrease is a significant parameter for variable selection. The Gini index can describe the overall explanatory power of the variables."
